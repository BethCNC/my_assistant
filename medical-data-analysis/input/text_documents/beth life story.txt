My Granny and I
This is a photograph of my Granny and me circa 1990. I believe my Granny had the same condition I have, and I feel her voice needs to be heard for the first time. She couldn’t lift her right arm for the last 15 years of her life, always said she was super flexible like me when she was younger, had loose skin that I loved to rub, lost her teeth, had a hunchback, and died suddenly from a stomach aneurysm. She suffered from severe social anxiety and never put her needs first.
My Realization
Only recently, after three years of not participating in life and obsessively learning design or researching my symptoms, I have come to realize that I might be autistic and have gone my entire life without a diagnosis. I am also diagnosed with ADHD, and I think my psychiatrists and I were very close to identifying my autism when I was in my early twenties. During that time, I underwent an assessment that clearly indicated attention deficits and I was also advised to follow up with further testing for learning disabilities. It was discovered that I have a reading comprehension learning disability, despite having a very high IQ. This, combined with my social inadequacies, obsessive and repetitive behaviors, and overall life experiences and chronic shortcomings, all started to make sense once I understood what autism actually was and how much it correlates with my life.
Childhood Experiences
As a child, I always felt different, insecure, scared, and worried. I never understood why, but at the age of ten, I lost most of my hair, developed bulimia and anorexia, and started a lifelong, extremely toxic relationship with food. The doctors suggested stress and anxiety were the causes of my hair loss. My parents were getting separated and I never felt like I could stop doing my job, which was to make sure everyone was happy all the time. I struggled to make friends and was always in the shadows of my older sister or older best friend. In hindsight, I realize that I had stimming behaviors that were quickly shamed and shut down.
The Impact on My Life
I quickly learned it was my job to keep the peace and be seen and not heard, and that the only issue with me being in pain was that I needed to learn not to complain about it, not to deal with it or address it or even acknowledge it. I vividly remember being made to quit travel soccer because I got hurt too much and always complained about being hurt. This key life lesson has plagued me and is one of the main reasons I suffer so much physically now. I have never known how to communicate my level of pain to necessary medical professionals, adults, or anyone that can actually help me and after so many years of my shoulder hurting at an intolerable level and no one believing me, I began to even question if my pain was real. At the same time, I was researching people who could mentally convince themselves to endure and even enjoy pain so that I could learn to breathe through my pain and convince my brain it wasn’t real, which I actually got pretty good at.
Once I had spinal fusion surgery to “fix” my shoulder pain that had been controlling my life for almost ten years, I started experiencing other health problems that were too significant to be ignored. I have always struggled with nausea and vomiting, which I have attributed to my many years of bulimia. I started throwing up almost every single day, every time I tried to do anything that required energy. I would carry grocery bags as vomit bags in my car for the ride to and from work as I always got sick then. I even started getting in trouble at work for going to the bathroom too much because I was always sick and didn’t tell anyone the reasons I needed to be in the bathroom so often.
Then came my swollen knee and a staph infection on my face, both appearing simultaneously in December of 2019 (four months post spinal fusion). Both of these issues were so unexpected and severe, and also untreatable. From this point on, my health and body have continued to deteriorate, leading me to endless doctor’s appointments, diagnoses, misdiagnoses, medical gaslighting, and most importantly, chronic pain and joint damage.
Discovering My Autism
On April 27, 2024, after another typical day of obsessively trying to figure out what was wrong with me—why I felt so physically terrible and struggled with communication skills—I stumbled upon an online assessment for autism in adults. I was completely shocked when I scored a 99%, indicating there was a 99% chance I had autism spectrum disorder. I proceeded to take several other online assessments and aced every single one, scoring in the highest category on every test.
Before this time, I did not have a clear understanding of what autism even was. It had never crossed my mind to include that word in my life or vocabulary, but after each test, I found myself relating to everything I read or saw about living life as an undiagnosed autistic female. I even tried to find things to convince myself I was wrong, but I couldn’t. I had never heard the term “masking” until then, and once I understood what masking was, everything started falling into place.
Masking My True Self
Masking is all I know. I quickly learned I have no idea how to exist in a world that requires me to make my own decisions based on what I need and want. Not only do I have no idea how to do this, but transitioning into adulthood and independence has been literally impossible for me, as I only know how to function if I am doing something someone wants or needs from me. I truly have no idea how to think for myself and make decisions based on what I want. I don’t even know what I want, actually. All I have ever known is to copy and paste other people’s behaviors and to follow the “rules” or standards that society deems necessary for certain situations.
I always excelled in a school or work setting. I was in college for almost ten years and I loved it. I now realize it was because in these situations, there are standards of expectation that are clearly defined, giving me guidelines to know what is supposed to be done so I can achieve it. Without a set of clear instructions, I am absolutely clueless.
Transitioning to Work from Home
As my health began deteriorating rapidly, I concluded that the best thing to do for work and income would be to work from home. I have spent the past three years teaching myself everything there is to know about graphic design, web design, and all things design in between. I learned it all and became quite good at design. The problem arose once I obtained an amazing creative business coach who encouraged me to get going and work with real clients. Unfortunately, this led to one of the most severe “autistic meltdowns” I have ever experienced.
A Devastating Meltdown
At the time, I was not considering the possibility of having autism, so I just assumed it was a very intense panic attack. The short version of the story is that once I sent the client some first edits for approval, they didn’t immediately respond. It was late at night (as I am a night owl), which turned out to be the reason they didn’t respond, but that thought didn’t enter my head at all. I immediately assumed they hated the designs I had sent them and spiraled into a deep panic that ended with me on the bathroom floor, losing my vision, and not even being able to see my phone to text my creative coach for help.
Forced to Ask for Help
My boyfriend had to call her and tell her I was non-functioning at the moment (as I literally couldn’t put a clear sentence together), and my coach had to jump in and complete the project for me. Since then, I have been terrified of engaging with real-world clients and have no idea how to turn this new life skill into a career that provides financial stability.
My Personal Relationship Effects
Another significant piece of this puzzle for me is the impact my illness has had on my personal relationships. When you constantly express pain and sickness, those words can become a source of annoyance for others. I've realized that the more frequently you mention your pain, the less it is heard and believed. This is particularly true within my support system. Simply stating that I am always in pain or don't feel well does not convey the extent of my suffering. Instead, it often prompts people to dismiss my complaints as mere attention-seeking, resulting in a lack of support and understanding.
This situation can be further complicated when finances are involved. In December 2019, I had a difficult conversation with my mom about my inability to continue working due to severe health issues, including vomiting every day on the way to and from work. My mom generously offered to provide financial support while I sought medical help to determine the root of my problems and find a solution.
Unfortunately, I now realize that my mom never truly believed me, and her skepticism persists to this day. Since our agreement, I have diligently fulfilled my end of the bargain. I have dedicated every moment of my time to figuring out how to generate income and live a simple life. There hasn't been a single day where I haven't actively pursued starting a business or career. However, I have struggled immensely with communicating and socializing with anyone, which has hindered my progress.
For the past three years, I have been housebound and unable to communicate with anyone outside of my boyfriend. I do not engage in texting, calling, emailing, or any form of communication with other human beings. This lack of interaction has led to a complete breakdown in my relationship with my mom. She perceives me as selfish, entitled, ungrateful, and inconsiderate because I do not engage with her more. Her belief is that if she provides financial assistance, I owe her something in return, such as my time and attention.
What my mom fails to recognize is that I am utterly incapable of communicating with anyone, especially her. Every communication I receive from her is a continuous string of verbal and emotional abuse. As a technology enthusiast who spends most of my time on computers, I coded a custom GPT to analyze my conversations with my mom (which I always get in writing to avoid gaslighting). The results were disheartening due to the amount of ableist abuse they revealed. As a highly logical person, I understand this isn't intentional, as most people don't grasp how my brain works or the extent to which certain interactions can cause me harm. However, I'm exhausted from constantly having to educate those around me about my mental and health conditions. Unfortunately, I've spent more time defending myself and proving my illness than getting the help I need. This is partly because I'm easily influenced by others' opinions and prone to feeling defeated.
Now
For the past 6-8 weeks, I've experienced near-constant spasms in my right arm, shoulder, chest, and back. The pain is unbearable, especially in my shoulder, which has caused me problems for ten years, even after spinal fusion surgery. These spasms make it difficult to use my computer, hindering my ability to work and support myself. Additionally, I've had muscle spasms throughout my body for almost a year, primarily in my calves and arms. My legs are constantly hurting, feeling numb, cramping, or spasming. Even as I write this, my left foot is cramping, and my right arm is spasming. I don't know how much of this is due to my diet and how much is physiological.
Food
That is a perfect segue for me to mention my diet. I don't know how to eat. I have hated food my entire life, and since it has always been considered my fault, I have only occasionally received support for this issue, and nothing has lasted. In the past, when hospitalized for not eating, I used to beg doctors to leave feeding tubes in. Food disgusts me, and I have absolutely no appetite. On top of that, I am nauseous or vomiting half the time. I get most of my nutrition from milk, protein powder, and Diet Mountain Dew because my body craves the sodium, and it's the only thing I can tolerate. Yes, I am fully aware that I'm obsessed and addicted to it. I recently tried electrolyte gummy vitamins, which I think helped. I want to eat better, but I can't; I've tried my entire life. This is one of the areas where I know I desperately need support, and I'm hoping an official diagnosis could help someone understand that I most likely have ARFID (Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder). I desperately need help finding ways to stay hydrated and get proper nutrition.
Tough Life Lessons
Some difficult life lessons I learned just in the past 5 years of being sick are 
Doctors are not all there to help you and will not have all the answers. 
Medical gaslighting is unfortunately a societal problem that also affects me
I am engaged in an ongoing internal discourse regarding the extent to which my inability to effectively convey my pain and symptoms contributes to my current situation, as opposed to the degree to which medical professionals may be unwilling to consider unconventional approaches or exert additional effort to ascertain an appropriate, non-standard, or uncommon cause or solution.
People in general do not have any desire to listen to someone with  chronic pain or health issues because to them it seems like chronic complaining without results.
It helps to have self confidence while going through a difficult diagnostic process to be able to stand firm in what you know to be true and not be convinced it isn’t.
Obviously this is something I don’t have.
Being chronically ill and unable to work but not having a condition with clear testing and diagnostic standards, in this country, is a recipe for debt as our disability system requires clear diagnosis and testing for validation of illness.

I also don’t sleep well and never really have. As a child, I always slept with my older sister and had nightmares; I would cover myself completely with stuffed animals. In middle and high school, I would wake up in the middle of the night and do obsessive and repetitive sets of push-ups, sit-ups, and all kinds of other exercises. In college, I stayed up all night, mostly due to substances and the fact that diet pills with ephedrine were still legal. Now, I stay up all night for reasons I can only guess at, but after learning more about autism, I am starting to believe that I only truly feel free to unmask at night when everyone else is asleep. It’s the only time I can really eat and relax, so I stay up all night until the sun comes up, sleep for around 4–5 hours, and then get up and do it all over again.

I proceeded to take several other online assessments and aced every single one, scoring in the highest category on every test.
Before this time, I did not have a clear understanding of what autism even was. It had never crossed my mind to include that word in my life or vocabulary, but after each test, I found myself relating to everything I read or saw about living life as an undiagnosed autistic female. I even tried to find things to convince myself I was wrong, but I couldn’t. I had never heard the term “masking” until then, and once I understood what masking was, everything started falling into place.
Masking My True Self
Masking is all I know. I quickly learned I have no idea how to exist in a world that requires me to make my own decisions based on what I need and want. Not only do I have no idea how to do this, but transitioning into adulthood and independence has been literally impossible for me, as I only know how to function if I am doing something someone wants or needs from me. I truly have no idea how to think for myself and make decisions based on what I want. I don’t even know what I want, actually. All I have ever known is to copy and paste other people’s behaviors and to follow the “rules” or standards that society deems necessary for certain situations.
I always excelled in school or work settings. I was in college for almost ten years and I loved it. I now realize it was because, in these situations, there are standards of expectation that are clearly defined, giving me guidelines to know what is supposed to be done so I can achieve it. Without a set of clear instructions, I am absolutely clueless.
Transitioning to Work from Home
As my health began deteriorating rapidly, I concluded that the best thing to do for work and income would be to work from home. I have spent the past three years teaching myself everything there is to know about graphic design, web design, and all things design in between. I learned it all and became quite good at design. The problem arose once I obtained an amazing creative business coach who encouraged me to get going and work with real clients. Unfortunately, this led to one of the most severe “autistic meltdowns” I have ever experienced.
A Devastating Meltdown
At the time, I was not considering the possibility of having autism, so I just assumed it was a very intense panic attack. In short, after sending the client initial edits for approval, they didn’t respond immediately. It was late at night (as I am a night owl), which turned out to be the reason they didn’t respond, but that thought didn’t enter my head at all. I immediately assumed they hated the designs I had sent them and spiraled into a deep panic that ended with me on the bathroom floor, losing my vision, and not even being able to see my phone to text my creative coach for help.
Forced to Ask for Help
My boyfriend had to call her and tell her I was non-functioning at the moment (as I literally couldn’t put a clear sentence together), and my coach had to jump in and complete the project for me. Since then, I have been terrified of engaging with real-world clients and have no idea how to turn this new life skill into a career that provides financial stability.
My Personal Relationship Effects
Another significant piece of this puzzle for me is the impact my illness has had on my personal relationships. When you constantly express pain and sickness, those words can become a source of annoyance for others. I’ve realized that the more frequently you mention your pain, the less it is heard and believed. This is particularly true within my support system. Simply stating that I am always in pain or don’t feel well does not convey the extent of my suffering. Instead, it often prompts people to dismiss my complaints as mere attention-seeking, resulting in a lack of support and understanding.
This situation can be further complicated when finances are involved. In December 2019, I had a difficult conversation with my mom about my inability to continue working due to severe health issues, including vomiting every day on the way to and from work. My mom generously offered to provide financial support while I sought medical help to determine the root of my problems and find a solution.
Unfortunately, I now realize that my mom never truly believed me, and her skepticism persists to this day. Since our agreement, I have diligently fulfilled my end of the bargain. I have dedicated every moment of my time to figuring out how to generate income and live a simple life. There hasn’t been a single day where I haven’t actively pursued starting a business or career. However, I have struggled immensely with communicating and socializing with anyone, which has hindered my progress.
For the past three years, I have been housebound and unable to communicate with anyone besides my boyfriend. I do not engage in texting, calling, emailing, or any form of communication with other human beings. This lack of interaction has led to a complete breakdown in my relationship with my mom. She perceives me as selfish, entitled, ungrateful, and inconsiderate because I do not engage with her more. Her belief is that if she provides financial assistance, I owe her something in return
