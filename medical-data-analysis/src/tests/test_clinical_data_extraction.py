PATIENT ENCOUNTER NOTE
Date of Service: 09/15/2023
Provider: Dr. Jane Smith, Rheumatology

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Patient presents with joint pain and fatigue.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
30-year-old female with a history of hypermobility syndrome presents today with complaints of 
worsening joint pain, particularly in the fingers, wrists, and knees. Patient reports increased 
fatigue over the past 3 months. She describes the pain as "constant aching" that worsens with 
activity. She was previously seen by Dr. Mark Johnson in Neurology on 08/10/2023 for evaluation 
of possible dysautonomia.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Ibuprofen 600mg PRN for pain
2. Cymbalta 30mg daily for pain management
3. Vitamin D3 2000 IU daily

ALLERGIES:
Penicillin - hives

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Hypermobility syndrome, diagnosed 2018
- Chronic fatigue
- Irritable bowel syndrome

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital Signs: BP 118/76, HR 82, Temp 98.6Â°F
General: Patient appears tired but in no acute distress.
Musculoskeletal: Generalized joint hypermobility noted with Beighton score of 7/9. Tenderness to 
palpation of multiple finger joints bilaterally. Mild synovitis of the right wrist. Bilateral knee 
hyperextension observed.

I note significant laxity in the finger joints and hyperextension of elbows beyond 10 degrees.
The patient demonstrates skin hyperextensibility and easy bruising on the extremities.

ASSESSMENT:
1. Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder with features suggestive of hEDS (hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome)
2. Chronic pain syndrome
3. Suspected dysautonomia - will need further evaluation

PLAN:
1. Order comprehensive connective tissue panel
2. Referral to geneticist for formal hEDS evaluation
3. Continue current medications
4. Physical therapy 2x/week for joint stabilization exercises
5. Follow up in 6 weeks

Dr. Smith explained, "Your symptoms and physical examination are consistent with hypermobile 
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, but genetic testing is important to rule out other types of EDS."

FOLLOW-UP:
Return in 6 weeks. Call sooner if symptoms worsen.
