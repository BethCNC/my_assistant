# Medical Data Pipeline Development Status

## Completed Components

### Ingestion Pipeline Architecture
- Created end-to-end pipeline architecture with extraction, processing, AI analysis, and storage
- Implemented pipeline initialization with configurable options
- Added file and directory processing capabilities
- Created processed_data output directory structure

### Vector Database Integration
- Implemented `MedicalVectorStore` for semantic search across medical entities
- Created `VectorDBIntegration` to connect pipeline with vector storage
- Added custom JSON handling with `NumpyEncoder` for embedding serialization
- Implemented search functionality for similar medical entities

### AI Components
- Set up framework for medical entity extraction
- Implemented text analysis components
- Created embedding generation for medical documents

### Storage Mechanisms
- Implemented database session management
- Created entity models and DAOs for medical entities
- Set up document metadata preservation

### Testing Infrastructure
- Created comprehensive test configuration with common fixtures and helpers
- Implemented unit tests for key components:
  - Extraction components for different document types
  - Vector database functionality and embedding
  - AI processing and entity extraction
  - Ingestion pipeline components
- Developed integration tests for the complete pipeline flow
- Added test utilities for mocking external dependencies
- Implemented test runner for executing all tests

## Known Issues

### Method Naming Consistency
- ✅ Fixed: `MedicalVectorStore` has `generate_embedding()` method
- ✅ Fixed: Pipeline calls `embed_text()` method which didn't exist
- ✅ Fixed: Standardized method names and added appropriate aliases

### Integration Points
- ✅ Fixed: Vector DB post-processor registration connection
- ✅ Fixed: Data flow between pipeline components

### Error Handling
- ✅ Fixed: Most error scenarios are caught and logged
- ✅ Fixed: Recovery mechanisms tested and verified

### JSON Serialization
- ✅ Fixed: Custom handling for numpy arrays implemented and tested
- ✅ Fixed: Consistent handling across all serialization points

## Next Steps

### Complete Testing
- ✅ Created unit tests for individual components
- ✅ Developed integration tests for the full pipeline
- Test with various medical document formats
- Implement performance and stress testing
- Add test coverage reporting

### Enhance Vector Database Implementation
- Finalize semantic search capabilities
- Test performance with large datasets
- Optimize embedding storage and retrieval

### Enhance AI Analysis
