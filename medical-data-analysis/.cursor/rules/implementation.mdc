# Medical Data Pipeline Development Status

## Completed Components

### Ingestion Pipeline Architecture
- Created end-to-end pipeline architecture with extraction, processing, AI analysis, and storage
- Implemented pipeline initialization with configurable options
- Added file and directory processing capabilities
- Created processed_data output directory structure

### Vector Database Integration
- Implemented `MedicalVectorStore` for semantic search across medical entities
- Created `VectorDBIntegration` to connect pipeline with vector storage
- Added custom JSON handling with `NumpyEncoder` for embedding serialization
- Implemented search functionality for similar medical entities

### AI Components
- Set up framework for medical entity extraction
- Implemented text analysis components
- Created embedding generation for medical documents

### Storage Mechanisms
- Implemented database session management
- Created entity models and DAOs for medical entities
- Set up document metadata preservation

## Known Issues

### Method Naming Inconsistency
- `MedicalVectorStore` has `generate_embedding()` method
- Pipeline calls `embed_text()` method which doesn't exist
- Need to standardize method names or add an alias

### Integration Points
- Vector DB post-processor registration may not be connected
- Need to verify data flow between pipeline components

### Error Handling
- Most error scenarios are caught and logged
- Need to verify recovery mechanisms work correctly

### JSON Serialization
- Custom handling for numpy arrays is implemented but may need testing
- Need to ensure consistent handling across all serialization points
## Next Steps

### Fix Immediate Issues
- Reconcile method naming discrepancy between `generate_embedding` and `embed_text`
- Review and test error recovery mechanisms
- Verify all integration points are connected correctly

### Implement Testing
- Create unit tests for individual components
- Develop integration tests for the full pipeline
- Test with various medical document formats

### Complete Vector Database Implementation
- Finalize semantic search capabilities
- Test performance with large datasets
- Optimize embedding storage and retrieval

### Enhance AI Analysis
- Improve medical entity extraction accuracy
- Implement specialized models for EDS and ASD
- Add temporal relationship analysis

### Documentation
- Add docstrings for all methods
- Create user guide for pipeline usage
- Document database schema and API

## Optional Enhancements

### DAG Implementation
- Implement Apache Airflow integration
- Create specialized operators for medical document processing
- Set up monitoring dashboards

### Frontend Integration
- Create API endpoints for web application
- Implement visualization components for medical timelines
- Develop search interface for vector database

### Security Enhancements
- Implement field-level encryption for PHI
- Add audit logging for all data access
- Create secure deletion workflows
