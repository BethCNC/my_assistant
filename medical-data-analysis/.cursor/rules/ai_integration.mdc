# AI Integration Requirements

## Text Analysis
- Extract semantic meaning from clinical notes and personal narratives
- Identify key medical concepts not explicitly coded
- Recognize contextual qualifiers (negation, uncertainty, severity)
- Process temporal references to establish chronology
- Identify cause-effect relationships in medical histories
- Analyze symptom descriptions in personal narrative texts

## Medical Knowledge Application
- Apply medical domain knowledge to interpret findings
- Identify condition progression patterns over time
- Detect potential comorbidities and symptom correlations
- Recognize standard treatment protocols and deviations
- Generate timeline visualizations of medical history
- Map relationships between hypermobility, neurodevelopmental, and autoimmune conditions

## Contextual Understanding
- Provide conversational access to medical history data
- Understand and respond to queries about symptom timelines
- Generate insights about condition relationships and interactions
- Explain medical terminology in accessible language
- Identify unexplored connections between symptoms and diagnoses
- Adapt response complexity to user technical knowledge

## Specialized Analysis
- Apply specialized models for connective tissue disorders (EDS)
- Implement autism spectrum disorder detection from narrative data
- Track chronic pain patterns and correlations
- Analyze sleep and dietary patterns from personal descriptions
- Identify potential patterns in symptom clustering
- Generate condition-specific insights based on latest research

## Reporting & Visualization
- Generate chronological summaries of medical history
- Create visual timelines of symptoms and treatments
- Produce specialty-specific views of medical data
- Visualize correlation between different symptoms
- Generate reports comparing symptoms against diagnostic criteria
- Create personal health dashboards with key indicators

## Ethical AI Guidelines
- Prioritize transparency in AI-generated insights
- Clearly distinguish between extracted facts and AI inferences
- Implement safeguards against potentially harmful recommendations
- Respect medical decision boundaries (no diagnosis or treatment advice)
- Maintain audit trails for all AI-generated content
