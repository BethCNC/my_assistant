{
  "tasks": {
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
      {
        "label": "Capture Idea",
        "type": "shell",
        "command": "python",
        "args": ["notion_agent.py", "capture", "${input:ideaText}"],
        "group": "build"
      },
      {
        "label": "Weekly Review",
        "type": "shell", 
        "command": "python",
        "args": ["notion_agent.py", "review"],
        "group": "build"
      }
    ],
    "inputs": [
      {
        "id": "ideaText",
        "description": "What idea do you want to capture?",
        "default": "",
        "type": "promptString"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Then use `Cmd+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Tasks: Run Task" ‚Üí "Capture Idea"

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Workflows
Create your own commands by extending the `NotionAgent` class:

```python
def project_standup(self):
    """Generate daily project standup"""
    # Your logic here
    pass
```

### Automation Ideas
- **Daily planning**: Auto-create today's agenda
- **Email processing**: Parse emails ‚Üí Notion tasks  
- **Meeting notes**: Auto-structure from transcripts
- **Goal tracking**: Weekly progress on objectives

## Troubleshooting

**"Database not found"**: Make sure your Notion integration has access to the database and the ID is correct.

**"API rate limit"**: The script includes basic rate limiting, but heavy usage might need delays.

**Property errors**: The script assumes standard database properties (Name, Category, Priority, Created). Adjust for your schema.

## Next Steps

1. **Try the basic commands** to get familiar
2. **Set up Cursor tasks** for quick access
3. **Customize properties** in `notion_agent.py` to match your databases
4. **Add new commands** for your specific workflows
