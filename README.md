2. `python notion_agent.py inbox` - Process 3-5 inbox items max
3. Choose **3 focus tasks** for the day (ADHD-friendly limit)

### Throughout the Day
- `python notion_agent.py capture "thought"` - Instant capture
- Work from **Next Actions** only - avoid task switching
- Use **energy matching** - high-energy work during peak times

### Evening Routine (5 minutes)  
1. Mark completed tasks as done
2. Quick capture of final thoughts
3. Preview tomorrow's potential focus

### Weekly (30 minutes)
1. `python notion_agent.py review` - PARA method analysis
2. `python notion_agent.py business` - Client and project check
3. `python notion_agent.py health` - Medical appointments and tracking

## Troubleshooting

**Database Connection Issues**: 
- Verify database IDs in `.env` file
- Ensure Notion integration has access to all databases
- Check database property names match your setup

**AI Suggestions Not Working**:
- Verify OpenAI API key is valid
- Check internet connection
- Try simpler capture text to test

**Overwhelming Information**:
- Use the **Emergency Reset Protocol**:
  1. Focus only on `daily` command
  2. Process max 3 tasks per session
  3. Ignore complex features until comfortable

## Advanced Customization

### Custom Property Mapping
Edit `notion_agent.py` to match your exact database properties:

```python
# Update these to match your database schema
"Task": {"title": [{"text": {"content": analysis["title"]}}]},
"Status": {"select": {"name": analysis["category"]}},
"Priority": {"select": {"name": analysis["priority"]}},
```

### Energy-Based Views
Create filtered views in Notion:
- **High Energy Tasks**: Complex creative work, client calls
- **Medium Energy Tasks**: Administrative work, planning
- **Low Energy Tasks**: Filing, organizing, reviewing

### Custom AI Prompts
Modify the AI context in `_load_system_context()` to include your specific:
- Project types and workflows
- Client communication preferences  
- Health tracking priorities
- Personal productivity patterns
