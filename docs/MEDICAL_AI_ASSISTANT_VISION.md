# AI-Driven Chronic Illness Management: Vision & Workflow

## Goals
- Use AI to help manage multiple chronic illnesses
- Replace/augment expensive patient advocate with automated, intelligent support
- Organize and unify all medical data (appointments, labs, notes, etc.)
- Prepare for doctor appointments with professional, accurate summaries
- Enable a single source of truth (Notion/web app) accessible by medical team

## Pain Points
- Medical data is scattered, unorganized, and hard to import/clean
- Notion health dashboards (esp. medical calendar) are incomplete
- Manual prep for appointments is time-consuming and error-prone
- No system exists for timeline/summary generation from raw data

## Desired Automations
- Ingest and clean raw medical data (from Notion, PDFs, CSVs, etc.)
- Sync all data into Notion health dashboards (esp. medical calendar)
- Summarize past year (or any period) for any provider/condition
- Generate printable handouts (PDF/Markdown) for appointments
- Answer any question about medical history using unified data
- Enable web app for team access (future)

## Role of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Learn from all available data (Notion, raw files, past conversations)
- Retrieve relevant info for appointment prep, Q&A, and summaries
- Adapt to user preferences and medical context

## Next Steps
- Improve RAG to better ingest and organize medical data
- Automate summary/handout generation for appointments
- Systematize data import/cleaning from all sources
- Build toward a web app for unified access
