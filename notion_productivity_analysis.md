- Invoice tracking disconnected from daily task flow
- No clear client communication status visibility

**4. Health Management Complexity**
- Multiple health databases requiring separate maintenance
- Medical appointment follow-up tasks not integrated with main workflow
- Symptom tracking separate from daily productivity planning
**5. Inefficient Task Processing**
- "In Inbox" tasks may pile up without processing
- No clear GTD-style workflow implementation
- Missing quick capture mechanisms

**6. Life Areas Underutilization**
- Rich Life Areas system not fully leveraged for daily focus

**Simplified Status Workflow (Based on Expert Consensus):**
Following Tiago Forte's action-based organization and Marie Poulin's ADHD-conscious design:

**Capture & Process (Forte's "Just-in-Time" Approach):**
- `📥 Inbox` - Unprocessed items (immediate capture, process daily)
- `🎯 Next Action` - Ready to work on today (limited to 3 items max)

**Work & Collaboration (Poulin's Business Integration):**
- `🔄 In Progress` - Currently active work
- `👥 Waiting For` - External dependencies (with follow-up automation)

**Future & Knowledge (Bradley's PPV Approach):**

### Phase 2: Implement the ADHD-Friendly Productivity Loop

#### Morning Routine (10 minutes)
1. **Open Daily Command Center**
2. **Process Inbox Items:**
   - If task takes <2 minutes → Do immediately
   - If task is important → Set as "Next Action" 
   - If task needs more info → Keep in "Inbox" with notes
   - If task is someday → Move to "Someday Maybe"
3. **Choose 3 Focus Tasks** for the day
4. **Check Waiting For items** for any follow-ups needed

#### Throughout the Day
- **Capture everything** in Inbox immediately (don't lose thoughts)
- **Work from Focus Tasks only** - avoid task switching
- **Complete tasks sequentially** before starting new ones

#### Evening Routine (5 minutes)
1. **Mark completed tasks**
2. **Quick inbox scan** - capture any final thoughts
3. **Preview tomorrow's potential focus tasks**
