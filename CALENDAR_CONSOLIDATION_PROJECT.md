# Calendar Consolidation & Life Organization Project

## üéØ Project Overview

**Goal**: Create a unified, executive function-friendly calendar system that consolidates all scheduling needs into a coherent, shareable workflow that actually gets used.

**Problem Statement**: 
- ADHD/Autistic brain struggles with traditional calendar management
- Multiple disconnected systems (Google Calendar, Notion Calendar, Medical Database, Tasks Database)
- Boyfriend needs visibility into medical appointments and schedule
- 42 years of calendar system failures need a different approach

## üìä Current State Assessment

### Google Calendar (bethcnc.com)
*[To be documented after calendar review]*

**Structure Analysis Needed:**
- [ ] Calendar count and names
- [ ] Sharing permissions and visibility
- [ ] Event types and categories
- [ ] Color coding system (if any)
- [ ] Recurring event patterns
- [ ] Integration points with other services
- [ ] Usage patterns and pain points

### Notion Integration Points
**Medical Calendar Database**
- [ ] Schema and properties structure
- [ ] Appointment types and categorization
- [ ] Link to Google Calendar (if any)
- [ ] Recurring appointment handling

**Tasks Database** 
- [ ] Date-related task properties
- [ ] Task categorization relevant to scheduling
- [ ] Priority and urgency fields
- [ ] Connection to calendar events

**Notion Calendar**
- [ ] Current usage patterns
- [ ] Integration with databases
- [ ] Sync status with Google Calendar

### Current Pain Points
- [ ] Calendar systems don't talk to each other
- [ ] Information scattered across platforms
- [ ] No shared visibility for partner
- [ ] Executive function barriers to maintenance
- [ ] Lack of consistent usage patterns

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
1. **Single Source of Truth**: One main calendar that aggregates all scheduling needs
2. **Partner Visibility**: Boyfriend can see medical appointments and important events
3. **ADHD-Friendly**: System works WITH executive function challenges, not against them
4. **Notion Integration**: Leverages existing Notion workflow and databases
5. **Actually Used**: System is intuitive enough to maintain consistently

### Specific Outcomes
- [ ] All medical appointments visible to partner
- [ ] Task deadlines integrated with calendar view
- [ ] Automated synchronization between systems
- [ ] Simplified event creation process
- [ ] Clear visual organization (colors, categories)
- [ ] Mobile accessibility for on-the-go updates

## üîÑ Data Sources & Integration Points

### Primary Sources
1. **Google Calendar (bethcnc.com)** - Main calendar platform
2. **Notion Medical Database** - Structured medical appointment data
3. **Notion Tasks Database** - Task deadlines and date-sensitive items
4. **Notion Calendar** - Secondary calendar view

### Integration Requirements
- **Google Calendar ‚Üî Notion**: Bidirectional sync for medical appointments
- **Tasks ‚Üí Calendar**: Deadline visualization and time blocking
- **Sharing**: Partner access to relevant calendar information
- **Mobile**: Ensure all systems work on phone for real-time updates

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Current State Documentation
- [ ] Google Calendar API integration to analyze current structure
- [ ] Export and analyze Notion Medical Database
- [ ] Map current Notion Tasks Database structure
- [ ] Document sharing permissions and access patterns

### Phase 2: System Design
- [ ] Design unified calendar taxonomy (event types, colors, categories)
- [ ] Plan sharing strategy for partner visibility
- [ ] Design automation workflows between systems
- [ ] Create ADHD-friendly maintenance protocols

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] Set up Google Calendar API access
- [ ] Create Notion integration scripts
- [ ] Implement synchronization workflows
- [ ] Configure sharing and permissions
- [ ] Test mobile accessibility

### Phase 4: Optimization
- [ ] Monitor usage patterns
- [ ] Iterate on ADHD-friendly features
- [ ] Optimize automation rules
- [ ] Refine partner sharing scope

## üß† ADHD/Executive Function Considerations

### Design Principles
- **Minimal Friction**: Reduce steps required for common actions
- **Visual Clarity**: Clear color coding and visual organization
- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks and data entry
- **Forgiveness**: System should work even with inconsistent maintenance
- **Mobile-First**: Must work seamlessly on phone for impulse scheduling

### Common Executive Function Challenges to Address
- **Time Blindness**: Need visual time estimation and buffer time
- **Task Switching**: Minimize context switching between apps
- **Memory Issues**: System should prompt and remind, not rely on memory
- **Overwhelm**: Clean, uncluttered interface with clear priorities
- **Inconsistency**: System should function even with irregular use

## üìã Research & Discovery Tasks

### Google Calendar Analysis
- [ ] Use Google Calendar API to export all calendar data
- [ ] Identify current calendar structure and naming conventions
- [ ] Analyze event patterns and categories
- [ ] Document sharing settings and permissions
- [ ] Review recurring events and their management

### Notion Database Analysis  
- [ ] Export Medical Database schema and sample data
- [ ] Export Tasks Database schema and date-related fields
- [ ] Analyze current Notion Calendar usage
- [ ] Document existing automation and templates

### Partner Requirements Gathering
- [ ] Define what medical appointments need to be visible
- [ ] Determine preferred sharing method (shared calendar, notifications, etc.)
- [ ] Understand partner's calendar system and preferences
- [ ] Plan integration with partner's existing workflows

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Google Calendar API setup and current state analysis
2. **Week 1**: Complete current state documentation across all systems
3. **Week 2**: Design unified system architecture and sharing strategy  
4. **Week 3**: Begin technical implementation and testing
5. **Week 4**: Partner integration and real-world testing

## üìù Notes & Considerations

### Technology Stack
- **Google Calendar API**: Primary calendar manipulation
- **Notion API**: Database synchronization and management
- **Python/Node.js**: Automation scripts and integrations
- **Zapier/Make**: Potential no-code automation options
- **Firebase**: Could handle authentication and real-time sync

### Success Metrics
- Daily calendar usage consistency
- Partner satisfaction with medical appointment visibility
- Reduction in missed appointments or deadlines
- Decreased stress around scheduling and time management
- Successful integration of all data sources
