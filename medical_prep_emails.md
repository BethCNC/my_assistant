Hi beth! You are correct, I understand all of this and none of it is surprising. It does make a huge difference when it finally starts to click in your own head though! That in itself is a breakthrough.

We are meeting on thursday, please check your email for the Google calendar invite. We can definitely prep on Thursday for your GP and fill in more symptoms in the other categories as we go. The quercetin and eventually low dose naltrexone will be an absolute breakthrough moment for you in beginning to get this all stable. I mentioned those just because they're two of the easiest things to get started in this whole process while the diagnoses are coming.

I will be at Angelene's this afternoon for Sam's sewing lesson. I know we planned to get started on the website stuff and meeting their regularly next week, but if you have time to drop by today just to say a casual hello and visit the space it would be great to see you! I always find it's easier to get somewhere for a meeting when I've already been there before.

If you search for Angelene's with that spelling, the one with an i is in a different place, it's on walk up avenue. Monroe.

Basically I have this huge overwhelming feeling of releif for the first time in so so long after finally hearning more about MCAS (via podcast) and it finally clicking in my brain how all of this is connected and the trifecta and holy cow this finally might actually be it.

Everyone around us was sick over christmas with that bug and I was shocked I never got it. Jump to Dec 31 when I go for my CT angiogram of my neck and everything was fine during the scan. The tech told me she would be using twice the amount of dye as usual. When I got home about an hour later, I felt like death. All my things started flaring, my face was on fire (face infection was raging), and I kept saying I felt like I couldn't breathe. Still not understanding mast cells yet, I wondered if I had picked up Covid at the hospital or what it was but I literally laid in bed for 4 days and didn't move. Everything hurt so bad that I was wrapped in heating pads and massing leg compressors and couldn't get anything done in terms of even being able to look at my computer and make things make sense. Finally Saturday night I was googling and came across something mentioning contrast dye and MCAS and I immediately took a hydrozozine (it was the only antihistamine I could find at the moment) since I have had a prescription for a while and I really think it helped. I have continued to take a couple to see if it helps and it has. I then have listened to the Bendy Bodies Podcast a ton about the "trifecta" and all things. I haven't wanted to take too many of anything until I ordered the quercetin but I have noticed my face infection and the flushing and burning of my face has drastically reduced and my breathing has become less labored.

> I am sure you are probably shaking your head and thinking, I knew it and I think you are spot on in your assessment of it being all three. I think for some reason, I hadn't taken the time to learn about mast cells enough and my brain has to understand how and make it make sense somehow for me to accept it.

> I have to admit I spent all day Monday Jan 6th just trying to write this email and got to the line above and fell asleep. I spent the first half of the day trying to sit up and type it and then I just fell asleep mid writing (after taking my adderrall morning and afternoon dose). This is how I have felt ever since the CT scan. It's like I can't sit up very long at all and I can't get my brain to focus or think anything and I have basically been staring at a wall for days and can't function. I have several design projects to work on and I can't make my brain work at all.

> I am curious to hear if you have heard of similar experiances with contrast dyes and mast cell reactions and just wanted to let you know the status of everything becuase it felt like a very pivotal moment for me to wrap my head around it all. Also I have to admit, I have never had the thought that I would get better. Everything I have been told is that I would just progresssively always get worse so I have a new found since of hope that something as simple as an antihistamine and figuring out all my triggers could allow for some restoration and healing and that is amazing. I can already feel my brain fading after focusing on this email for a while so I will end here and look foward to your feedback Thursday.
