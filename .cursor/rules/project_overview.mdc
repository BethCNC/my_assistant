# Medical Data Processing Project

## Project Goals
- Extract and normalize medical data from multiple formats (PDF, text, HTML, CSV, RTF, Markdown)
- Process and analyze medical history with focus on chronic conditions (EDS, ADHD, ASD, chronic pain)
- Create a comprehensive, chronologically sorted medical database with symptom tracking
- Enable backend integration with a personal health website
- Support an interactive chatbot with comprehensive medical history understanding

## Data Types to Process
- Medical test results (Labs, X-rays, MRIs, etc.) with corresponding dates
- Doctor's notes and appointment summaries
- Personal health narratives and symptom descriptions
- Diagnostic criteria for conditions (ASD, EDS, etc.)
- Medical assessments and test results
- Medical imaging documentation and findings
- Medication history and effectiveness tracking

## Technical Approach
- Convert all document formats to processable text while preserving metadata
- Normalize dates to ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Standardize medical terminology using medical coding standards
- Apply NLP to extract symptoms, treatments, and medical events from unstructured narrative text
- Create a chronological event timeline correlating medical events with symptoms
- Integrate specialized structure for neurodivergent and connective tissue conditions
- Support personal symptom tracking and correlation with diagnosed conditions

## Key Features to Develop
- Chronological medical timeline with filterable events
- Symptom tracking and correlation with treatments
- Cross-referencing between personal narratives and clinical documentation
- Provider directory with specialty categorization (rheumatology, neurology, etc.)
- Specialized knowledge representation for hypermobility and neurodivergent conditions
- Conversational interface for exploring medical history with context awareness
