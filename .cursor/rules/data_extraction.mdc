# Data Extraction Guidelines

## Document Processing
- Create specialized extractors for each identified format:
  - PDF medical records and timelines
  - HTML patient health summaries
  - CSV symptom and lab tracking data
  - MD/Markdown formatted lab results
  - Plain text doctor's notes and personal narratives
  - RTF clinical notes with formatting
- PDF processing should use OCR when text extraction fails
- Extract both content and metadata (dates, sources, document types)
- Preserve document structure including sections and hierarchies
- Tag unrecognized or ambiguous data for human review

## Source-Specific Processing
- Extract structured data from Novant Health text files using consistent naming patterns
- Process Atrium and Novant Health HTML files for complete patient summaries
- Extract data from Notion-formatted medical notes with proper link resolution
- Process personal narrative text for symptom descriptions and onset dates
- Implement specialized extraction for diagnostic criteria documents
- Handle medical imaging report formats with impression vs. narrative sections

## Metadata Extraction
- Extract document creation and event dates from filenames (e.g., YYYY-MM-DDThh_mm_ssZ format)
- Identify healthcare providers from document headers and signatures
- Extract medical specialties from document context or directory structure
- Identify test types and result values with their reference ranges
- Recognize document relationships and sequencing
- Preserve provider-specific reference numbers and identifiers

## Quality Assurance
- Maintain audit trail of extraction process with provenance tracking
- Store original document hash for future validation
- Record confidence scores for extracted information
- Implement validation rules for common medical data patterns
- Flag potential extraction errors for human review
- Verify chronological consistency across multiple documents

## Technical Implementation
- Implement fault-tolerant processing to handle partially corrupted files
- Batch process documents with similar formats
- Report extraction statistics by document type and source
- Support incremental processing as new documents are added
- Implement format detection for unlabeled files
- Provide debugging tools for extraction verification
