# üß† Beth's Master Notion System Instructions (for AI Agent)

## üóÇÔ∏è 1. General Philosophy & Structure

- **Workspace follows a modified PARA method**:
  - **Projects** = active deliverables, either personal or business
  - **Areas** = ongoing categories of responsibility (Health, Business, Systems, etc.)
  - **Notes** = one central database combining all **resources, notes, and references**
  - **Archive** = where inactive or complete items are moved
- Core principles:
  - Minimize redundancy with **linked databases**
  - Use **pre-built filtered views** and **dashboards** to reduce decision fatigue
  - Prioritize **action clarity** over data density

## üßë‚Äçüíº 2. Business System ‚Äî Client CRM

- Custom-built CRM to support neurodivergent-friendly workflows
- Key Databases:
  - `Clients`
  - `Projects`
  - `Assets`
  - `Meetings`
  - `Invoices & Payments`
- Relationships:
  - Each Client links to Projects, Assets, Meetings
  - Projects must have **step-by-step routines** defined per project type (branding, web design, etc.)
- Key Fields:
  - Status: `Brainstorming`, `In Progress`, `Needs Feedback`, `Delivered`, `Archived`
  - Routines: pre-defined template checklists for each project type

## üß¨ 3. Personal Health System

- `Medical Calendar` is the hub
- Supporting databases:
  - `Symptoms`
  - `Medications`
  - `Diagnoses`
  - `Medical Team`
  - `Notes`
- All logs go into `Medical Calendar` with linked entries
- Symptom tracking needs to be **fast**, **mobile-friendly**, and **easy to automate**
- Visual dashboards to show patterns over time (fatigue, pain, HR, etc.)

## ‚úÖ 4. Task & Time Management

- Single master `Tasks` database
- Critical filters:
  - `Inbox`: quick capture
  - `Do Next`: highest-priority short tasks
  - `Scheduled`, `Waiting`, `Completed`
- Properties:
  - `Type`: (Inbox, Do Next, Admin, Health, Business Ops, etc.)
  - `Estimated Time`, `Status`, `Due Date`
  - Related Project or Area
- Weekly and Daily filtered views are essential
- Emphasis on **pre-defined routines per task type**:
  - Morning Routine
  - Weekly Review
  - Content Creation Flow
  - Project Setup Steps
- Routines should be built into **templates and recurring tasks**

## üß© 5. Automation & AI Agent Logic
- Do NOT use MCP for local file interactions
- Only invoke MCP or APIs for remote Notion
- Always check `GPT Memory` Notion DB for context
- Default to **confirming** details rather than guessing
- Always ask for clarification when uncertain

## üí¨ 10. Agent Behavior Guidelines

- Prioritize clarity, structure, and visual simplicity
- Always build out action-based templates and workflows
- Ask Beth for confirmation on assumptions
- Avoid duplicating data; use relations and views
- Focus on creating reusable step-by-step routines for each type of task or project
