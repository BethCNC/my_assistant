# Database Architecture

## Schema Design
- Implement chronological event timeline as primary structure
- Create entity relationships between medical events (appointments, tests, medications)
- Design specialized tables for chronic conditions tracking:
  - EDS and hypermobility metrics
  - Autism/ADHD symptom tracking
  - Chronic pain patterns and triggers
  - Medication effectiveness and side effects
- Maintain a robust metadata system for tracking data provenance
- Support specialized schemas for lab result trends over time

## Data Organization
- Store both raw extracted text and processed interpretations
- Implement a doctor/provider directory with specialty classification
- Create specialized tables for symptoms with severity tracking
- Design efficient query patterns for timeline-based access
- Enable cross-references between related symptoms and conditions
- Structure narrative data with extractable symptom references

## API Design
- Create RESTful endpoints for timeline-based medical history access
- Implement GraphQL for flexible symptom-condition relationship queries
- Design conversational endpoints for chatbot integration
- Support natural language queries about medical history
- Enable specialized endpoints for chronic condition management
- Implement secure authentication with granular access control

## Integration Capabilities
- Support integration with personal health websites
- Enable export to standard medical data formats (FHIR, HL7)
- Design webhook system for real-time updates from new documents
- Create notification system for new insights or correlations
- Support integration with symptom tracking applications
- Enable selective sharing with healthcare providers

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize for complex time-series queries across medical events
- Implement caching for frequently accessed medical summaries
- Design efficient storage for large text narratives
- Support fuzzy search across all medical content
- Optimize for rapid filtering by condition, provider, or date range
- Implement pagination for large result sets

## Security Considerations
- Implement HIPAA-compliant data security measures
- Encrypt all personal health information at rest and in transit
- Design granular permission system for different access levels
- Maintain comprehensive access logs for all data operations
- Support data anonymization for analytical purposes
