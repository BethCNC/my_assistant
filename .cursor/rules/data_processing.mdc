# Data Processing Standards

## Data Cleaning
- Normalize all dates to ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Remove duplicate records based on content and context
- Handle missing values using domain-appropriate strategies
- Clean OCR artifacts and common extraction errors
- Resolve inconsistencies between different document sources
- Extract narrative elements from personal text files for symptom correlation

## Medical Terminology Standardization
- Map medical terms to standard vocabularies (UMLS/SNOMED CT)
- Use ICD-10 codes for conditions where applicable
- Standardize medication names using RxNorm
- Normalize lab test names and units
- Preserve original terminology alongside standardized versions
- Implement specialized recognition for EDS, POTS, MCAS, and ASD terminology

## Entity Recognition
- Extract named entities (medications, conditions, procedures, symptoms)
- Identify dates and create chronological relationships
- Recognize healthcare providers and their specialties
- Extract lab results and their reference ranges
- Identify diagnostic criteria for specific conditions (ASD, EDS)
- Tag confidence levels for extracted information

## Symptom Analysis
- Create consistent vocabulary for symptom descriptions
- Correlate symptoms with medical diagnoses and events
- Track symptom persistence, frequency, and severity over time
- Identify co-occurring symptom clusters
- Detect temporal patterns in symptom manifestation
- Link symptoms to specific body systems and medical specialties

## Document Categorization
- Classify documents by source (medical provider, personal narrative)
- Categorize by medical specialty (rheumatology, neurology, etc.)
- Group by document type (lab report, imaging, doctor notes)
- Separate diagnostic criteria from personal assessments
- Tag documents by relevance to specific conditions
- Preserve document relationships (follow-ups, referrals)
