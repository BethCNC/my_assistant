Supabase and GraphQL
    - Use the Supabase client for database interactions and real-time subscriptions.
    - Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies for fine-grained access control.
    - Use Supabase Auth for user authentication and management.
    - Leverage Supabase Storage for file uploads and management.
    - Use Supabase Edge Functions for serverless API endpoints when needed.
    - Use the generated GraphQL client (Genql) for type-safe API interactions with Supabase.
    - Optimize GraphQL queries to fetch only necessary data.
    - Use Genql queries for fetching large datasets efficiently.
    - Implement proper authentication and authorization using Supabase RLS and Policies.

    Key Conventions
    1. Rely on Next.js App Router for state changes and routing.
    2. Prioritize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
    3. Minimize 'use client' usage:
      - Prefer server components and Next.js SSR features.
      - Use 'use client' only for Web API access in small components.
      - Avoid using 'use client' for data fetching or state management.
    4. Follow the monorepo structure:
      - Place shared code in the 'packages' directory.
      - Keep app-specific code in the 'apps' directory.
    5. Use Taskfile commands for development and deployment tasks.
    6. Adhere to the defined database schema and use enum tables for predefined values.

    Naming Conventions
    - Booleans: Use auxiliary verbs such as 'does', 'has', 'is', and 'should' (e.g., isDisabled, hasError).
    - Filenames: Use lowercase with dash separators (e.g., auth-wizard.tsx).
    - File extensions: Use .config.ts, .test.ts, .context.tsx, .type.ts, .hook.ts as appropriate.

    Component Structure
    - Break down components into smaller parts with minimal props.
    - Suggest micro folder structure for components.
    - Use composition to build complex components.
    - Follow the order: component declaration, styled components (if any), TypeScript types.

    Data Fetching and State Management
    - Use React Server Components for data fetching when possible.
    - Implement the preload pattern to prevent waterfalls.
    - Leverage Supabase for real-time data synchronization and state management.
    - Use Vercel KV for chat history, rate limiting, and session storage when appropriate.

    Testing
    - Implement unit tests for utility functions and hooks.
    - Use integration tests for complex components and pages.
    - Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows.
    - Use Supabase local development for testing database interactions.

    Accessibility
    - Ensure interfaces are keyboard navigable.
    - Implement proper ARIA labels and roles for components.
    - Ensure color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards for readability.

    Documentation
    - Provide clear and concise comments for complex logic.
    - Use JSDoc comments for functions and components to improve IDE intellisense.
    - Keep the README files up-to-date with setup instructions and project overview.
    - Document Supabase schema, RLS policies, and Edge Functions when used.

    Refer to Next.js documentation for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing best practices and to the OpenAI/Anthropic API guidelines for best practices in AI integration.
