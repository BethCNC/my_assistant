# Chronic Illness Tracking System Implementation Plan

## Important Documentation Principles

**CRITICAL: ALL medically relevant information must be preserved during this project. Never delete, summarize, or abbreviate any medical findings, test results, diagnoses, or treatment plans. Only non-medical filler text may be excluded during organization.**

## Phase 1: Medical History Import Project

### Objective
Create a comprehensive medical history database by systematically importing past records from local folders into your Notion system while preserving all medically relevant information.

### Preparation Tasks
1. **Create an Import Template**
   - Create a simplified template in your Medical Calendar for historical data entry
   - Include only essential fields: Name, Date, Type, Doctor, Related Diagnoses, Key Information, File Attachment
   - Add a "Historical Import" tag to track which entries have been migrated from archives

2. **Organize Import Views**
   - Create a dedicated view in your Medical Calendar called "Historical Import"
   - Sort by date (oldest to newest) to maintain chronological organization
   - Add filters to show only historical entries for easy tracking of progress

3. **Set Up Staging Area**
   - Create a simple table (could be in Notion or a spreadsheet) to track:
     - Folder name/date
     - Status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
     - Number of documents
     - Special notes/flagged items

### Medical Document Processing Guidelines

1. **Complete Information Preservation**
   - ALL medically relevant information must be preserved during import
   - Never summarize or abbreviate actual medical findings, test results, diagnoses, or treatment plans
   - Maintain exact medical terminology as used by healthcare providers
   - Preserve numerical values and units exactly as recorded (lab values, vital signs, etc.)
   - Do not interpret or reword medical information in any way

2. **Appropriate Summarization**
   - Only summarize or remove non-medical filler text (e.g., standard form language, redundant headers)
   - Never paraphrase or reinterpret medical findings or instructions
   - When in doubt about relevance, include the information
   - Keep all dates, times, and provider identification information intact

3. **Document Attachment Protocol**
   - Attach original document scans/images whenever possible
   - Use the "Personal Notes" field for your own observations and context
   - Keep "Doctors Notes" field for direct transcription of provider comments

4. **Flagging System for Special Information**
   - Flag any information about:
     - Medication allergies or adverse reactions
     - Surgical interventions or procedures
     - New diagnoses or changes to existing diagnoses
     - Treatment plan modifications
     - Follow-up requirements

### Implementation Steps

1. **Initial Folder Assessment (1-2 hours)**
   - Open the folder: `/Users/bethcartrette/REPOS/beth_health_journey_app/data/atrium-exports/all_import`
   - List all year folders and count approximate number of documents
   - Make initial priority decisions based on medical significance (not just chronology)

2. **Chronological Import Process (Starting with Most Critical)**
   - **Step 1: Major Events First**
     - Identify and import surgeries, hospitalizations, major diagnoses
     - Create entries in Medical Calendar with Type field appropriately set
     - Attach scanned documents or photos of physical records
     - Link to relevant doctors, diagnoses, and symptoms
     - Preserve ALL medical details exactly as written in original documents

   - **Step 2: Regular Medical Appointments**
     - Import significant doctor visits and consultations
     - Focus on visits that resulted in diagnosis changes, medication adjustments
     - Complete Doctor field and Doctors Notes with verbatim medical information
     - Link to Medical Team database members
     - Include all medical recommendations and treatment plans exactly as written

   - **Step 3: Lab Results & Imaging**
     - Import significant lab work and diagnostic tests
     - Record key values in the Lab Result field exactly as shown in documents
     - Record all abnormal results with exact values and reference ranges
     - Include all technical and clinical comments from providers
     - Link to related diagnoses and symptoms

   - **Step 4: Daily Health Records (if available)**
     - Import any existing symptom tracking or daily health logs
     - Focus on flare periods or significant symptom changes
     - Use batch entry for similar consecutive days
     - Preserve all symptom descriptions in their original detail

3. **Folder Processing Protocol**
   - Process one year folder at a time
   - Within each year, follow priority order: major events → appointments → tests → daily logs
   - Mark folder as "In Progress" while working, then "Completed" when finished
   - Set session goals (e.g., "Complete 2022 folder this weekend")
   - Create complete entries preserving all medical details

4. **Quality Control**
   - After completing each year folder, review entries for:
     - Missing relations (unlinked doctors, diagnoses, etc.)
     - Incomplete information that needs research
     - Duplicate entries
     - Chronological accuracy
     - Verification that no medical information was omitted

5. **Relation Validation**
   - Ensure all imported historical records have appropriate connections:
     - Every doctor's appointment is linked to a doctor in Medical Team
     - Every diagnosis has a corresponding entry in Diagnoses
     - Every medication mentioned has an entry in Medications
     - Create missing database entries as needed

### Time Allocation Guide
- Schedule specific "import sessions" of 1-2 hours
- Set realistic goals for each session (e.g., "Import 5 major events" or "Complete 1 month of records")
- Alternate between recent (more relevant) and older (historical context) records to maintain engagement

### Import Checklist for Each Document
- [ ] Create appropriate entry in Medical Calendar
- [ ] Set correct Type property
- [ ] Enter accurate Date
- [ ] Link to Doctor(s) involved
- [ ] Link to relevant Diagnoses
- [ ] Link to Medications discussed/prescribed

     - Date: {% now %}
     - Empty fields for all symptom scores and medication checkboxes

2. **Create Form-Like Experience**
   - Add a dedicated page for your daily check-in process
   - Use toggle blocks with prompts like:
     - "How did you sleep last night? (Rate 1-8)"
     - "What is your energy level today? (Rate 1-5)"
     - "Rate your pain levels in these areas (1-10)"
     - "Any new or unusual symptoms today?"
     - "What medications have you taken so far?"
     - "What activities helped or hindered your wellness today?"

3. **Set Up Medication Tracking System**
   - Create a "Medication Schedule" database with:
     - Medication name
     - Scheduled times
     - Days of week
     - Dosage
     - Special instructions
   - Link this to your daily template
   - Add reminder properties for each medication time block

4. **Implement Notification System**
   - Set up Notion reminders for morning and evening check-ins
   - Configure time-based reminders for specific medications
   - Consider using a third-party app like HealthSync to send notifications

### Implementation Steps

1. **Morning Check-in Flow**
   - Create bookmark to Daily Health Check-in page on mobile device
   - Set up routine to complete morning section after first medication
   - Include checklist of morning medications
   - Rate sleep quality and morning symptoms

2. **Evening Check-in Process**
   - Complete remaining sections before bed
   - Check off all medications taken throughout day
   - Record any symptom changes or flare triggers
   - Add "Glows & Grows" reflection

3. **Weekly Review Implementation**
   - Schedule 15-minute weekly review session (e.g., Sunday evening)
   - Create weekly review template with prompts:
     - "What patterns did you notice this week?"
     - "Which medications seemed most/least effective?"
     - "What symptom management strategies worked best?"
     - "What questions should you ask at your next appointment?"
     - "What adjustments would help next week?"

4. **Test and Refine**
   - Use the system for 2 weeks and note friction points
   - Adjust template questions based on relevance
   - Simplify any overly complex elements
   - Add any missing tracking elements

### Maintenance Plan

1. **Daily Routine (10 minutes total)**
   - Morning check-in (5 minutes)
   - Evening completion (5 minutes)

2. **Weekly Review (15 minutes)**
   - Review the week's entries
   - Identify patterns
