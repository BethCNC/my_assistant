# Health Data Extraction & Organization Plan

## Project Overview
This document outlines the systematic approach to extract, organize, and prepare all medical data from PDF files for import into a Notion chronic illness tracking database.

## Extraction Strategy

### 1. Text Extraction from PDFs
- The raw text extraction has already been performed for summary files and is available in TXT format
- All PDFs will be processed using the following categorization:
  - Lab Results (blood tests, urine tests, other body fluid tests)
  - Imaging Results (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, ultrasounds)
  - Doctor Visit Notes
  - Procedures documentation
  - Medical summaries

### 2. Data Organization Structure
Each extracted record will be processed into a standardized JSON format with the following fields:
- `record_type`: Lab Result, Imaging, Doctor Visit, Procedure, Daily Journal
- `date`: Date of event in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `provider`: Name of doctor or healthcare provider
- `facility`: Healthcare facility name
- `title`: Brief descriptive title
- `category`: Medical specialty (Rheumatology, Endocrinology, etc.)
- `diagnoses`: Array of related diagnoses
- `details`: Full text of the record
- `values`: Array of test values (for lab results)
  - `name`: Test name
  - `value`: Test value
  - `unit`: Unit of measurement
  - `reference`: Reference range
  - `flag`: H (high), L (low), or null (normal)
- `observations`: Key clinical observations
- `recommendations`: Follow-up instructions or recommendations
- `file_source`: Original source file path

### 3. De-Duplication Process
- Group records by date and type
- Compare content similarity
- Flag potential duplicates for manual review
- For lab results, create consolidated view with latest values

### 4. Timeline Creation
- Chronological organization of all medical events
- Flagging of key milestone events:
  - Diagnoses
  - Surgeries and procedures
  - Medication changes
  - Significant symptom flares

## Processing Workflow

### Step 1: Initial Data Sorting
- Process all files by year and category
- Create JSON data structures for each file
- Store in organized folder structure

### Step 2: Consolidation
- Merge related records (e.g., multiple lab tests from same day)
- Create comprehensive views by test type (e.g., all TSH values over time)
- Generate longitudinal data for trend analysis

### Step 3: Quality Validation
- Verify all dates are correctly formatted
- Ensure no data loss occurred during extraction
- Validate all medical values are accurately preserved
- Cross-reference with health summary for completeness

### Step 4: Notion Templates Creation
- Design standardized templates for each record type
- Create database schemas with appropriate relations
- Define views for different analysis perspectives
- Develop tracking dashboards for ongoing monitoring

## CRITICAL RULES FOR ALL DATA HANDLING

1. **Complete Information Preservation**
   - ALL medically relevant information must be preserved
   - Never summarize or abbreviate actual medical findings, test results, diagnoses
   - Maintain exact medical terminology as used by healthcare providers
   - Preserve numerical values and units exactly as recorded
   - Do not interpret or reword medical information

2. **Medical Data Integrity**
   - All lab values must be recorded with their exact values and units
   - Reference ranges must be included where available
   - Dates must be consistently formatted
   - Provider names must be standardized

3. **Relation Preservation**
   - Relationships between diagnoses, symptoms, and treatments must be maintained
   - Medication information must include exact dosage, frequency, and prescribing provider
   - Time-based relationships (before/after) must be accurately preserved

## Execution Timeline

### Week 1: Infrastructure Setup & Initial Processing
- Complete folder organization
- Process all summary documents
- Extract core medical history timeline

### Week 2-3: Document Processing
- Process all lab results from 2018-2025
- Process all imaging studies
- Process all doctor visit notes
- Generate standardized JSON data files

### Week 4: Quality Control & Validation
- Verify all data for accuracy and completeness
- Identify and resolve any duplicates or inconsistencies
- Validate chronology and relationships

### Week 5: Notion Database Creation
- Set up database structure based on extracted data model
- Create templates for all record types
- Develop import scripts and procedures

### Week 6: Data Import & Dashboard Creation
- Import all processed records into Notion
- Set up relationship links between databases
- Create tracking dashboards and views
- Develop daily monitoring templates
